Qiuchen (Bruce) Qian is a Ph.D. Candidate at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk), supervised by [Dr. David Boyle](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/david.boyle) and co-supervised by [Prof. Hamed Haddadi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gkA7zvoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). He received an M.Sc. degree in Applied Computational Science and Engineering from Imperial College (2020) and a B.Eng. in Electronic and Electrical System Engineering at [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/) (2019). 

His research interests lie in general Cyber-Physical Systems and Operations Research, focusing on optimal Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) mission planning under uncertainties. He is also keen on applying optimization theories to real-world considerations like practical energy management and spatial optimization of UAVs.

Beyond his academic pursuits, he has a deep passion for Xiangqi (Chinese chess) and badminton sport.
